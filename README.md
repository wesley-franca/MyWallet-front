# MyWallet

<h1>MyWallet is an application made to track your finances.

<h1>It was my first full stack application, where I developed both the front-end and back-end from scratch using React.js, styledComponents, NodeJs, express, and other technologies and tools</h1>
<h1>It was amazing to me when I saw my app deployed and working as a real website that people would actually use</h1>
